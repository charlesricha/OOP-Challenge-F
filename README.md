## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.8 or later installed
   - VS Code (recommended) or any Python IDE

2. **Running the program**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository 
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-pet.git](https://github.com/charlesricha/OOP-Challenge.git)

   python main.py
   
## 🎮 Features
1. Create and name your virtual pet

2. Interactive menu system:

3. Feed your pet (eat())

4. Put your pet to sleep (sleep())

5. Play with your pet (play())

7. Teach new tricks (train())

8. View learned tricks (show_tricks())

9. Visual status indicators

10. Persistent trick memory

## 💡 Learning Objectives
